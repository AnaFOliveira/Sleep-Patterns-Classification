# Sleep-Patterns-Classification

Sleep Patterns Classification Recognition programmed in Matlab.

This project was made in scope of the course Diagnostic and Auto-Regulation Algorithms in the University of Coimbra. The objective of this work is to process the signal data into different sleep phases (clusters).

"Sleep is	a physiologic state related to unconsciousness, reduced stimuli responsiveness, rest, and is required for a healthy life. Abnormal sleep patters are related to pathologies, such as sleep apnoea. Sleep is not always a desired physiologic state, as for example during driving. Thus sleep detection and classification is essential for clinical and also non-clinical applications.

From a macroscopic point of view sleep is organized in several stages. According to the American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) four stages are recognized: rapid-eye movement (REM), non-rapid eye movement (NREM) stage	1, NREM stage	2 and NREM stage 3. In clinics, sleep classification is based on the polysomnography exam that is composed by four signal types: electroencephalogram (EEG), electrocardiogram (ECG), electromyogram (EMG) and electrooculogram (EOG).

In this assignment it is expected to apply different signal processing and clustering techniques aiming	to distinguish different sleep stages based on the EEG signals. Consider the database available at http://www.tcts.fpms.ac.be/~devuyst/Databases/DatabaseSubjects/ that contains 20 whole-night polysonmographic recording of 20 subjects. Data were acquired	in a sleep laboratory	of a Belgium hospital. At least two EOG	channels (P8-A1, P18-A1), three EEG channels (CZ-A1 or C3-A1, FP1-A1 and O1-A1) and one	submental	EMG	channel	were recorded. The signals were sampled at 200Hz and stored in standard European Data Format (EDF) file (eg. subject1.edf).

This assignment aims to cover the course topics:
1. Independent Component Analysis
2. Filtering
3. Wavelets
4. Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
5. Multi-dimensional scaling (MDS)
6. Clustering"
